# Instagram feed made with Bootstrap

Honestly this was waaaaay easier than when i did it with only html and css (responsive)

## Objective

Imitate [this design](https://github.com/breatheco-de/exercise-instagram-feed-bootstrap/blob/master/assets/preview.gif?raw=true?raw=true) of instagram feed using as many bootstrap classes as possible.
